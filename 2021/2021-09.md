### language
- Q. Why are signed ints often used instead of unsigned ints even for quantities that can't be negative? eg. `len()` returns signed ints
  - A. Use of uints in situations that seem harmless often may not be:
    ```go
    veggies := []string{"okra", "cauliflower", "lettuce"}
    for i := len(veggies)-1; i > 0; i-- {
      fmt.Println(veggies[i])
    }
    ```
    If `i` was unsigned, `i > 0` would always be true and this would infinite loop (`i` would cycle back to the max uint value)
    So uints generally only used for bitwise operators or when it's explicitly needed.

### language

- [Integer literals](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Integer_literals) can be used to define binary or hexadecimal directly
  - `0b` prefix for binary. eg. `b := 0b11011010` to define an 8-bit value of `11011010`
  - `0x` prefix for hexadecimal. eg. `hexa := 0xff` to define the hexadecimal `255`
- basic literals & shifting: https://play.golang.org/p/6zh9xySutRv
- Go's [math/bits](https://pkg.go.dev/math/bits#Len64) package has methods that facilitate getting the Most Significant Bit (MSB), the Least Significant Bit (LSB)

### language

- [Artihmetic](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Arithmetic_operators) shift operators
  - `<<` left shift (`x << y` means `x * 2^y`)
    - `1 << i`  = `1 * 2^i`
  - `>>` right shift (`x >> y` means `x * 2^-y`, aka `x รท 2^y`)
  - some use `**` double asterisks to denote 'power of'
