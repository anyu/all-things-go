### design
- While trying out [aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go), I was surprised to see that they often expected pointers for primitive types, eg. [string pointers](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/c41acdc4bbf45b00e3e12f76022cd28ee04a416d/aws/convert_types.go#L6).
  - Turns out many folks have inquired and contested this ([#114](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/114), [#205](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/205), [#363](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/363#issuecomment-137252886))
  - TLDR: Since many fields within the API are optional, they need a way to distinguish between unset values and values set to zero. Also they argue, for [backwards compatiblity](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/294#issuecomment-117282934). Still, the community is generally unhappy with their decisions here.

### language
- Go1.16 introduced the [embed](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) package that can be used to embed files in programs!
  - Embedding a file in a string
    ```go
    import _ "embed"

    //go:embed hello.txt
    var s string
    print(s)
    ```
  - Embedding files into a filesystem
    ```go
    import "embed"

    //go:embed hello.txt
    var f embed.FS
    data, _ := f.ReadFile("hello.txt")
    print(string(data))
    ```
- Go has a built in [print](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#print) function?! But intended only for debugging.

### tool
- [httpstat](https://github.com/davecheney/httpstat): curl stats visualizer (not a Go tool, but at least a tool built in Go)

### concept

I've been learning a bit about [Java concurrency and its use of threads](https://github.com/anyu/til/blob/main/java/concurrency.md), so I was curious to revisit Goroutines now and compare them.

- **Goroutines vs Java threads** (specifically, Java's [native threads](https://www.baeldung.com/java-threading-models); won't dig into its 'green threads' for now)
  - Java threads map 1:1 with OS threads, whereas goroutines exist only in the go runtime's virtual space (in the OS' user space, vs kernel space)
    - Goroutines are multiplexed onto multiple OS threads
    - the Go scheduler (part of the Go runtime) is needed since the OS scheduler only knows how to schedule kernel threads (the OS manages user-level threads as if they were a single-threaded process)
  - Java threads consume a lot of memory due to their fixed, large stack size (>1 MB. ~1000 threads would require ~1GB of memory), whereas a goroutine uses dynamically sized stacks and is initialized only with 2KB
  - Goroutines have faster startup + context switching time
    - Goroutines are only scheduled if it's doing useful work. If a goroutine is waiting on an empty channel, the scheduler doesnâ€™t run the goroutine. It sticks mostly idle goroutines on their own OS thread.
  - Goroutines can communicate with other routines (via channels) with low latency, whereas threads require the programmer to communicate using shared memory
    - Go's idiom: `Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.`
  - Resources

### language
- Since failed type assertions return the zero value of the type, be wary of it with variable shadowing ([50 Shades of Go](http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/index.html#failed_type_assert))
  - Unexpected
    ```go
    var data interface{} = "some string"

    if data, ok := data.(int); ok {
        fmt.Println("[is an int] value =>", data)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("[not an int] value =>", data)
        //prints: [not an int] value => 0
    }
    ```
  - Better
    ```go
    var data interface{} = "some string"

    if res, ok := data.(int); ok {
        fmt.Println("[is an int] value =>", res)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("[not an int] value =>", data)
        //prints: [not an int] value => great (as expected)
    }
    ```

### tools

- [go doc](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Show_documentation_for_package_or_symbol) vs [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc?utm_source=godoc). TLDR just use `go doc` unless have other goals.
  - `go doc` = a Go subcommand for generating docs
    ```go
    // from within dir with Go files
    go doc -all // prints all exported APIs with comments
    ```
  - `godoc` = a separate CLI tool. The original doc viewer, generates/serves docs via a web server. [Go1.13+](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.12#godoc) stopped bundling it with the Go binary.
    ```go
    go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc

    godoc -http=:6060 // serves docs at localhost:6060
    ```

## 2021-08-08

### language
- Clearing up types. There are two forms of [type declarations](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_declarations):
  1) **Alias declarations** (aka type aliases) - binds an identifier to the given type
      ```go
      type Name = string
      type dictionary = map[string]string
      ```
      - They *represent* the same type.
      - Go has two built-in type aliases:
        - `byte` is an alias of `uint8`
        - `rune` is an alias of `int32`
      - Aliases are intended to facilitate refactors, not really for general use
      - An alias should not be referred to as a 'type', though we may say it represents a type
  2) **Type definitions** - creates a new, distinct type with the same *underlying* type as the given type, and binds an identifier to it
      ```go
      type Name string
      type dictionary map[string]string
      ```
      - The new type is called a *defined type* (different from any other type, including the type it's created from)
- **[Defined Types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_definitions)**
  - There is a lot of confusion around this. From Go 1.9+, the following definition applies:
  - All basic types are considered **defined types** (eg. `string`, `int64`, `bool`)
  - A non-defined type must be a composite type (eg. `[]string`, structs, functions, channels, interfaces)
    - eg. a non-defined struct type is basically an anonymous struct
     ```go
    type A []string
    type B = A
    type C = []string

    // `C` and type literal `[]string` represent the same, non-defined type
    // `A` and `B` represent the same defined type
    ```
- **[Underlying Types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Types)**
  - Each type has an underlying type:
    - The underlying type of a built-in type is itself.
    - The underlying type of a non-defined type is itself.
    - In a type declaration, the new type and the source type have the same underlying type.
    ```go
    // The underlying types here are both int.
    type (
      MyInt int
      Age   MyInt
    )

    // The following new types have different underlying types.
    type (
      IntSlice   []int   // underlying type is []int
      MyIntSlice []MyInt // underlying type is []MyInt
      AgeSlice   []Age   // underlying type is []Age
    )

    // The underlying types of []Age, Ages, and AgeSlice are all the non-defined type []Age.
    type Ages AgeSlice
    ```

#### language
- Upcoming [go1.17](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.17) highlights:
  - `//go:build` preferred over `// +build`
  - some separator changes to URL query parsing
  - `testing`: New `-shuffle` flag enables random execution of tests
  - `time`: Some nicer layout methods
  - `net/url`: New `Values.Has` for checking if query param is set
- Clearing up initializing slices/maps once and for all
  ```go
  // nil slice, idiomatically preferred for declaring empty slices
  var s []string

  // slice literal, mostly preferred when want to start with non-zero values
  // sometimes referred to as `empty slice` to contrast with nil slice
  s := []string{}

  // mostly same as slice literal, but preferred when slice just needs zero value
  // allocates an array and returns a slice that refers to that array
  // can optimize by specifying len, capacity if known/fixed
  s := make([]string, 0)

  // creates pointer to a slice; rarer use case
  // same as `s := &[]string{}`
  s := new([]string)
  ```
  - both nil and empty slices have zero length, capacity
  - both can be used in for loops, appends
  - when JSON-marshalled, nil slice is encoded to `null`, empty slice to `[]`
  - `reflect.DeepEqual` does not consider `nil` and empty slice to be equal

  ```go
  // nil map, writing (but not reading) panics. Probably not desired.
  var m map[string]int

  // map literal, fine but slightly less idiomatic than using `make`
  m := map[string]int{}

  // mostly same as map literal, but preferred/most commonly used
  // can optimize by specifying size if known/fixed, `m := make(map[string]int, 10)`
  m := make(map[string]int)

  // creates pointer to a nil map; not often wanted
  m := new(map[string]int)
  ```

- Find size in bytes of operations via [reflect.TypeOf(s).Size()](https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#TypeOf)
  - [unsafe.Sizeof(s)](https://pkg.go.dev/unsafe#Sizeof) works too but not preferred. Not that interesting but [why it's in unsafe](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5602).
- Interesting characteristics of empty structs ([The empty struct - Dave Cheney](https://dave.cheney.net/2014/03/25/the-empty-struct))
  - Smallest building block in Go. Has size of 0 bytes (if all fields within are zero value). Not 0 bytes if taking address of.
  - Can be better than a boolean when you just need to indicate existence
    - eg. channels - when you want to notify that an event occurred, but don't need to pass info
    - eg. maps - when you just need a key, but not value. But boolean may be better overall for clarity.
- Generally, just return `nil` instead of `&SomeStruct{}` on errors. No one should deference the value without first checking the error, returning an actual value may muddle that for the reader (JW PR feedback)
  - Q. Exceptions to this?

## 2021-08-03

#### idiom/best practice
- Use full sentences with periods for doc comments; facilitates becoming godoc docs. ([GoCodeReview](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#comment-sentences))
- Error strings should not be capitalized or end w/ punctuation (unless proper nouns, acronyms); does not apply to logging (since usually not combined w/ other messages) ([GoCodeReview](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#error-strings))
- Use `crypto/rand` instead of `math/rand` for key generation - `math/rand` is too predictable (entirely so when unseeded, just a little entropy when seeded) ([GoCodeReview](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#crypto-rand))
- Prefer actual != expected vs the inverse in test fail messages ([GoCodeReview](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#useful-test-failures))
  ```go
  if got != tt.want {
    t.Errorf("Foo(%q) = %d; want %d", tt.in, got, tt.want)
  }
  ```

#### design
- Consider returning additional value to indicate validity in cases where caller would need to handle result differently, vs. returning in-band errors, such as -1/nil ([GoCodeReview](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#in-band-errors))
- eg. `func Lookup(key string) (value string, ok bool)`

#### terminology
- "naked return" = a return statement without arguments returning the named return values

#### language

- `nil` is not a keyword in Go, it's a [predefined identifier](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Predeclared_identifiers). It does not have a default type.
- nil types are not equal (nil pointer != nil interface), but nil values can satisfy interfaces
- `var s []string // nil slice` > `t := []string{} // non-nil, but zero-length`. Functionally equivalent, but former is preferred style.
  Caveat: Latter is useful in certain cases, eg. JSON-encoding: (`nil` slice encodes to `null`, `[]string{}` encodes to `[]`. ([GoCodeReview](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#declaring-empty-slices))

**Nil slices:** `var s []string`

| Action      			    | Behavior
| :-- | :--------------------------------
| len(s) | 0
| cap(s) | 0
| for range s | iterates 0 times
| s[i] | panic: index out of range


**Nil maps:** `var m map[t]u`

| Action      			    | Behavior
| :-- | :--------------------------------
| len(m) | 0
| for range m | iterates 0 times
| v, ok := m[i] | zero(u), false
| m[i] = x | panic: assignment to entry in nil map

Use `nil` maps as read-only empty maps


**Nil channels:** `var c chan t`

| Action      			    | Behavior
| :-- | :--------------------------------
| <- c | blocks forever
| c <- x | blocks forever
| close(c) | panic: close of nil channel

***Closed* channels:** `var c chan t`

| Action      			    | Behavior
| :-- | :--------------------------------
| v, ok <- c | zero(t), false
| c <- x | panic: send on closed channel
| close(c) | panic: close of nil channel

When a channel is closed, if you receive something on it, it'll return 0 and not block.
So might want to check closed status.

```go
var aClosed bool

select {
case v, ok := <-a:
	if !ok {
        aClosed = true
        continue
    }
...
}
```

Even if channel has received, once done, may need to close the channel to prevent deadlock.

But once a channel is closed, it no longer blocks. So, use nil channels to disable select cases (*switch off* channel,
but make sure not to close it)

```go
case v, ok := <-a:
	if !ok {
        a = nil
        fmt.Println("a is now closed")
        continue
    }
...
```
