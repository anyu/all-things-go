- Waitgroups
  - Useful for managing and blocking goroutines
  - For example, the `Inside goroutine` line won't print as it won't get a chance to execute before `main` terminates.
    ```go
    package main
      
    import "fmt"
      
    func someFunc() {
        fmt.Print("Inside goroutine")
    }
      
    func main() {      
        fmt.Println("Hey there")
        go someFunc()
        fmt.Println("Done with some func)
    }
    ```
  - With waitgroups, you can block/wait until all the waitgroups have executed, eg:

    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "sync"
    )

    func someFunc(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
        fmt.Println("Inside goroutine")
        wg.Done()
    }

    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hey there")

        var wg sync.WaitGroup
        
        wg.Add(1)
        go someFunc(&wg)
        wg.Wait()

        fmt.Println("Done with some func)
    }
    ```  

    ```shell
    $ go run main.go
    
    Hey there
    Inside  goroutine
    Done with some func
    ```
